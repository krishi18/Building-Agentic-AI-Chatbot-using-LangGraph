       "\"Published: 2024-07-22\\nTitle: Attention Is All You Need But You Don't Need All Of It For Inference of Large Language Models\\nAuthors: Georgy Tyukin, Gbetondji J-S Dovonon, Jean Kaddour, Pasquale Minervini\\nSummary: The inference demand for LLMs has skyrocketed in recent months, and serving\\nmodels with low latencies remains challenging due to the quadratic input length\\ncomplexity of the attention layers. In this work, we investigate the effect of\\ndropping MLP and attention layers at inference time on the performance of\\nLlama-v2 models. We find that dropping dreeper attention layers only marginally\\ndecreases performance but leads to the best speedups alongside dropping entire\\nlayers. For example, removing 33\\\\% of attention layers in a 13B Llama2 model\\nresults in a 1.8\\\\% drop in average performance over the OpenLLM benchmark. We\\nalso observe that skipping layers except the latter layers reduces performances\\nfor more layers skipped, except for skipping the attention layers.\\n\\nPublished: 2021-07-16\\nTitle: All the attention you need: Global-local, spatial-channel attention for image retrieval\\nAuthors: Chull Hwan Song, Hye Joo Han, Yannis Avrithis\\nSummary: We address representation learning for large-scale instance-level image\\nretrieval. Apart from backbone, training pipelines and loss functions, popular\\napproaches have focused on different spatial pooling and attention mechanisms,\\nwhich are at the core of learning a powerful global image representation. There\\nare different forms of attention according to the interaction of elements of\\nthe feature tensor (local and global) and the dimensions where it is applied\\n(spatial and channel). Unfortunately, each study addresses only one or two\\nforms of attention and applies it to different problems like classification,\\ndetection or retrieval.\\n  We present global-local attention module (GLAM), which is attached at the end\\nof a backbone network and incorporates all four forms of attention: local and\\nglobal, spatial and channel. We obtain a new feature tensor and, by spatial\\npooling, we learn a powerful embedding for image retrieval. Focusing on global\\ndescriptors, we provide empirical evidence of the interaction of all forms of\\nattention and improve the state of the art on standard benchmarks.\\n\\nPublished: 2023-06-02\\nTitle: RITA: Group Attention is All You Need for Timeseries Analytics\\nAuthors: Jiaming Liang, Lei Cao, Samuel Madden, Zachary Ives, Guoliang Li\\nSummary: Timeseries analytics is of great importance in many real-world applications.\\nRecently, the Transformer model, popular in natural language processing, has\\nbeen leveraged to learn high quality feature embeddings from timeseries, core\\nto the performance of various timeseries analytics tasks. However, the\\nquadratic time and space complexities limit Transformers' scalability,\\nespecially for long timeseries. To address these issues, we develop a\\ntimeseries analytics tool, RITA, which uses a novel attention mechanism, named\\ngroup attention, to address this scalability issue. Group attention dynamically\\nclusters the objects based on their similarity into a small number of groups\\nand approximately computes the attention at the coarse group granularity. It\\nthus significantly reduces the time and space complexity, yet provides a\\ntheoretical guarantee on the quality of the computed attention. The dynamic\\nscheduler of RITA continuously adapts the number of groups and the batch size\\nin the training process, ensuring group attention always uses the fewest groups\\nneeded to meet the approximation quality requirement. Extensive experiments on\\nvarious timeseries datasets and analytics tasks demonstrate that RITA\\noutperforms the state-of-the-art in accuracy and is significantly faster --\\nwith speedups of up to 63X.\""

       "AIMessage(content='\\n<think>\\nOkay, so I need to explain what AI is. Let me start by recalling what I know. AI stands for Artificial Intelligence. I think it\\'s when machines can perform tasks that usually require human intelligence. But wait, what exactly does that mean? Maybe I should break it down into parts.\\n\\nFirst, the basics. AI is a branch of computer science. The goal is to create systems that can perform tasks that typically demand human intelligence. Examples might include things like recognizing speech, making decisions, solving problems, learning from data. But I should make sure I don\\'t confuse AI with just any computer program. There\\'s a difference between traditional software and AI. Traditional software follows predefined rules, while AI can adapt and learn from experience. Hmm, so machine learning is a subset of AI, right?\\n\\nI should mention different types of AI. Maybe there\\'s a distinction between narrow or weak AI and general or strong AI. Narrow AI is designed for specific tasks, like voice assistants or recommendation systems. General AI would be more human-like, able to handle any intellectual task a human can. But I think general AI is still theoretical; we don\\'t have that yet.\\n\\nApplications are important too. Examples like Apple\\'s Siri, Amazon\\'s Alexa for voice recognition. Self-driving cars use AI for navigation. In healthcare, AI can help diagnose diseases. Maybe image recognition in X-rays. Also, in finance for fraud detection. These examples make it more concrete.\\n\\nHow does AI work? It often involves algorithms that process data. Machine learning uses statistical methods to improve performance over time. Deep learning is a subset of ML using neural networks with many layers. Neural networks are inspired by the human brain, but I should clarify that they are simplified models.\\n\\nI should also touch on limitations and ethical considerations. AI isn\\'t perfect; it can have biases if trained on biased data. There are privacy issues with data collection. Job displacement concerns, ethical dilemmas in decision-making like in autonomous vehicles.\\n\\nWait, maybe start with a simple definition, then expand. Make sure to cover the key points: definition, types, how it works, applications, and challenges. Avoid getting too technical but still accurate. Also, mention the difference between AI, machine learning, and deep learning to prevent confusion.\\n\\nLet me check if I missed anything. The history? Maybe not necessary unless it\\'s important. The user just asked \"what is AI?\" so focus on explanation rather than history. But maybe a brief mention of the field\\'s goals.\\n\\nAlso, common misconceptions. People might think AI is sentient, but currently it\\'s all about algorithms. It\\'s important to clarify that AI doesn\\'t have consciousness, just the appearance of intelligence.\\n\\nOkay, putting it all together in a structured way. Start with a definition, then break down the components. Maybe use bullet points or sections, but since the user wants a paragraph, I\\'ll need to flow it smoothly.\\n</think>\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines, designed to perform tasks that typically require human cognition, such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and perception. Here\\'s a structured breakdown:\\n\\n1. **Definition & Scope**:  \\n   AI is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems that can perceive their environment, learn from data, reason, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Unlike traditional software, which follows rigid, predefined instructions, AI systems can adapt through experience, often using algorithms and statistical models.\\n\\n2. **Types of AI**:  \\n   - **Narrow (Weak) AI**: Specializes in performing specific tasks. Examples include voice assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa), recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix, Spotify), and facial recognition.  \\n   - **General (Strong) AI**: A theoretical concept where AI would possess human-like cognitive abilities across multiple domains, enabling it to solve any intellectual task. This remains hypothetical, though researchers aim to develop it.\\n\\n3. **Core Technologies**:  \\n   - **Machine Learning (ML)**: A subset of AI where systems learn patterns from data to improve performance without explicit programming. Techniques include supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.  \\n   - **Deep Learning**: A specialized ML method using neural networks with many layers (deep neural networks) to process complex data like images, speech, or text (e.g., self-driving cars, chatbots).  \\n   - **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Enables machines to understand and generate human language (e.g., chatbots, translation tools).  \\n\\n4. **Applications**:  \\n   - **Healthcare**: Diagnostic tools, drug discovery, and personalized treatment plans.  \\n   - **Transportation**: Autonomous vehicles and route optimization.  \\n   - **Finance**: Fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and risk assessment.  \\n   - **Entertainment**: Content recommendations, virtual assistants, and game AI.  \\n\\n5. **How It Works**:  \\n   AI systems rely on **data**, **algorithms**, and **computational power**. They analyze large datasets to identify patterns, make predictions, or generate outputs. For instance, a recommendation system uses user behavior data to suggest products, while a self-driving car processes sensor data in real time to navigate.\\n\\n6. **Limitations & Challenges**:  \\n   - **Bias and Fairness**: AI can perpetuate biases if trained on skewed data (e.g., racial or gender biases in facial recognition).  \\n   - **Ethical Concerns**: Issues like privacy (data misuse), job displacement, and accountability for AI decisions (e.g., in healthcare or criminal justice).  \\n   - **Transparency**: \"Black box\" models (like deep neural networks) can be difficult to interpret, raising questions about trust and reliability.  \\n\\n7. **Misconceptions**:  \\n   - **Sentience vs. Simulation**: Current AI lacks consciousness or self-awareness; it mimics intelligence through algorithms.  \\n   - **Autonomy**: While AI can perform tasks independently, its decisions are based on programming and data, not independent thought.  \\n\\nIn summary, AI is a transformative technology that enhances efficiency and innovation across industries, but its development requires addressing ethical, technical, and societal challenges to ensure responsible and beneficial use.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1255, 'prompt_tokens': 14, 'total_tokens': 1269, 'completion_time': 3.08288924, 'prompt_time': 0.002883563, 'queue_time': 0.24220714499999998, 'total_time': 3.085772803}, 'model_name': 'qwen-qwq-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_512a3da6bb', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--8c05b61f-769c-441e-ae00-203bdd0d2e60-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 14, 'output_tokens': 1255, 'total_tokens': 1269})"
